# Using GitPod

Unless you're a data scientist, it's probably not necessary to use GitPod's Jupyter Notebook
features.  You already have access to a full terminal and can run your programs with ease.
Also, when using Jupyter Notebooks, you must use auth tokens.

Just use bash to execute python scripts.

## Python Interactive

You have a few options besides Jupyter Notebooks.  You can run python files in the terminal _or_ use something called **Python Interactive** which is like a mini Jupyter Notebook.

## .vscode Directory

`.vscode/` contains a settings.json file that pertains to the **GitPod** dev environment.
It does not adhere to my _local_ dev env setup.

```bash
# uname -a output:
